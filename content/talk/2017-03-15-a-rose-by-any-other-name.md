I gave the following Browserify talk at the Webpack edition of NodeSource's
monthly meetup. Webpack's Sean Larkin had given his "[Core Concepts][wbcc]" talk before
I went on, and I made a comparison to Browserify's concepts.

While my talk is chiefly satirical, I get serious towards the end: Webpack is
powerful because of how configurable it is. On the other hand, people like
Browserify because it's opinionated, so you can focus on building your project.
I hope to see improvements to Webpack in 2017 that make it more accessible.
