I have fond memories of playing the Dreamcast growing up, of many hours trying
to figure out *Ecco the Dolphin* in the days before ubiquitous home internet. A
few years ago I picked up a Dreamcast and installed an optical disc emulator
(ODE), and had a good time revisiting old games from my childhood. As a huge fan
of *Jet Set Radio Future* on the original Xbox, it was fun to play *Jet Grind
Radio* for the first time.

When I moved to the Netherlands I shipped over my consoles, including the
Dreamcast. Unlike most of my other consoles, the Dreamcast used an internal
power supply that was region-specific. As I had a North American console, it was
expecting 120V while the power system in the Netherlands is 240V.

For convenience I didn‚Äôt want the bulk of a step-down converter whenever and
wherever I wanted to play Dreamcast games. So I set out to replace the power
supply instead.

# Replacement Power Supplies

At first I looked at replacing the power supply with a SEGA OEM power supply for
the European region. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a power supply on its
own on eBay or the Dutch auction website Marktplaats, nor a ‚Äúfor parts‚Äù
Dreamcast. Most of my options were system bundles, which made this approach
uneconomical since I‚Äôd still need to replace the capacitors on the power supply.

I also looked at the [PicoDreamcast], which uses the PicoPSU and an external 12V
DC power brick. However, I wanted to avoid the extra bulk of an external power
brick. This also ruled out the similar [DreamPSU].

# Mean Well RPT-6003

Discouraged by my options, I happened across 3DprintRC‚Äôs [/r/Dreamcast
post][first-post] discussing the near perfect fit of Mean Well‚Äôs RPT-6003 power
supply in the Dreamcast. This is a modern universal power supply designed by a
company well-known for making high quality power supplies, and it provides all
the voltages needed by the Dreamcast.

3DprintRC later posted a [follow-up][second-post] showing the RPT-6003 being
used by cutting up the original power supply.  Unfortunately, my Dreamcast had a
different revision of the power supply which did not allow for such a clean cut.

I designed the [Dreamcast RPT], a small board that interfaces the RPT-6003 with
the Dreamcast‚Äôs AC connector and power button. In my design I focused on being
able to reuse many components already found on the OEM power supply, as well as
documenting widely available modern alternatives.[^1]

I had boards manufactured here in Europe with [AISLER] and they arrived a few
days later, looking great! It slotted into the Dreamcast case with no issue and
worked the first time. ü•≥

I‚Äôve released the board as open hardware under the CERN-OHL-W 2.0 license. I
designed it in [Horizon EDA], an open source PCB design suite. I‚Äôd love to see
others take and adapt the project. If you do, let me know what you build!

[^1]: I‚Äôm still hoping to find a drop-in replacement for the AC connector. The
    connector interlocks with the case, which rules out most without a case
    modification.
