I haven't considered writing about my life in general. I missed the LiveJournal
and Xanga trains and long form writing isn't a habit. I've noticed this
quarter, however, that a few people I follow, such as [Kevin Burke][kevin] and [Esten
Hurtle][esten], do. So this is my first attempt.

Believe it or not, I'm now in my fourth year at Cloudflare! I've spent most of
this quarter working on the backend pipeline for ordering SSL certificates,
currently being used by Cloudflare's [Dedicated Certificates][dcerts] feature. I'm
currently assisting other teams by working on data processing and aggregation.

I had been avoiding JavaScript conferences for a few years now, but in
September I traveled to IcelandJS in, you guessed it, Iceland. Unfortunately,
there was no aurora borealis during my visit, but I still met and made some
good friends. So far I've submitted talks to two JavaScript conferences,
JSConfEU in Berlin and nz.js(con); in Wellington, in 2017.

During the return from Iceland, I had a "layover" in Estonia. Yes, I
purposefully [flew the wrong direction][gcmap]. I was only in the country for twenty
hours, but I still had a great time sightseeing. I definitely want to check out
more of Estonia in future visits to Europe.

I've moved to Hayes Valley from South of Market, and have started to explore
the new neighborhood. I plan on bicycling to work, but I need to do some tune
up of my bike first. In the meantime, I'm riding the N-Judah into the
office.

Christmas travel has me visiting Texas for a few days. For the rest of the
time, if you're in San Francisco, I'd love to catch up for coffee or drinks.
Get in touch!

Best, Terin.
